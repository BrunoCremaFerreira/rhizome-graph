"""The daemon's configuration, as a value instead of as the surrounding air.

`daemon/server.py` used to learn what it was by reading `os.environ` in four
places, two of them deep inside the machinery. That works for exactly one caller
shape -- a shell script that exports variables and execs a module -- and breaks
the moment there is a second front door: a command on `$PATH` started in
whatever directory the user happens to be in, with a positional directory and
flags. Making the environment an internal protocol between two halves of one
program would leave the configuration invisible in a stack trace, untestable
without a subprocess, and impossible to build twice in one process.

So the configuration is a frozen :class:`Settings`, and :func:`settings_from` is
the one function that builds it. Three rules shape it:

  * **Flag beats environment beats default**, for every field. One rule, so a
    second front door can rely on it.
  * **Pure and total.** No filesystem, no `sys.exit`, no exception: every value
    here is one somebody can export by hand, and a typo in an optional knob must
    not cost a daemon its boot. `cwd` is a parameter for the same reason `home`
    is one in :mod:`rhizome_graph.paths` -- a function that reads the process's
    own working directory cannot be tested from another one.
  * **Nothing from the daemon side.** No `asyncio`, no `websockets`, no
    `watchdog`, no `daemon`: printing `--help` or refusing a bad flag must not
    first import an event loop, a WebSocket stack and an inotify backend.

That last rule is why the daemon's defaults are spelled here and imported by
`daemon/server.py` rather than the other way round. They are one value each, in
one place; two spellings of the same default drift, and then one of them is
wrong.

:func:`main` is the installed `rhi` command, and it is the one scope here that
reads the process environment, mirroring `daemon/server.py`'s rule. It decides --
purely, through :func:`choose_port` and :func:`ingest_socket_path` -- which port
and which ingest socket this instance may have, and only then hands a finished
:class:`Settings` to :mod:`rhizome_graph.launch`. The launcher exists because
running a daemon means `asyncio` and `daemon.server`, and importing either of
those to print `--help` is what the last rule above forbids.
