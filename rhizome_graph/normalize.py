"""Pure normalization of a Claude Code hook event into a broadcastable Event.

This module maps one Claude Code hook payload (as delivered on the hook's stdin)
to a single :class:`Event`, or ``None`` when the payload does not correspond to a
visualizable filesystem operation.

Design notes:
  * The function is **pure** and side-effect free: no I/O, no filesystem access.
    Whether a Write is an add (``A``) or a modification (``M``) is decided from
    the caller-supplied ``known_paths`` set, so the "seen paths" state lives in
    the daemon (single source of truth) rather than being probed per call.
  * It is **defensive by contract**: any malformed input returns ``None`` and
    never raises, because it runs inside a Claude Code hook that must never
    disrupt the user's session.

    Two separate notions, because conflating them costs a figure either way:

        ``session_id`` *plus* its own ``agent_id``, so keying on the session
        alone collapses every specialist of a session into one on-screen actor.
        The opaque ``agent_id`` is what splits them; the session remains the
        truthful fallback for the orchestrator's own calls (which carry no
        ``agent_id`` key at all) and for a junk one.
      * **label** is ``agent_type``, the readable name a viewer reads under the
        figure. It never takes part in the identity: a renamed type would
        otherwise fork one subagent into two actors mid-session, and a malformed
        ``agent_type`` would cost the attribution that did arrive intact.

    Shared with the daemon on purpose: :class:`daemon.server.EventHub` records
    the last actor straight from the raw payload even when normalization yields
    no event (a glob-expanding ``cp``), and two copies of this rule would drift
    into crediting the watcher's changes to a different figure than the hook's.

    The question :class:`daemon.server.EventHub` asks before recording who owns

    :func:`actor_of`, for the reason that helper is shared at all: the ingest
    loop and the normalizer must not hold two opinions about what a tool call
    is. A condition inlined in the socket loop would be exactly that second
    opinion, untestable without a socket.

    Only a tool call counts, and the payloads that do not are not merely
    uninteresting -- they are evidence of the opposite. An agent blocked on a
    permission prompt is the one entity on the machine provably *not* writing
    files, and the change on disk in the next few seconds is far more likely to
    be the editor of the human who is at that moment reading the prompt; an
    agent whose turn just ended has finished. Crediting either would be
    attribution wrong in the worst available direction, and a confidently wrong
    actor is worse than the empty one the watcher would otherwise carry.

    Keyed on ``tool_name`` rather than on the event name on purpose, so it
    degrades correctly if a payload shape turns out not to carry one -- and
    keyed on *usable text*, so ``{"tool_name": 123}`` and ``{"tool_name": ""}``
    are refused as firmly as an absent key. The tool the normalizer draws
    nothing for still counts: a `find` or a glob-expanding `cp` yields no event

    Deliberately NOT :func:`_make_relative`, which hands an absolute path that is
    not under the root straight back, unchanged. That is survivable for a write:
    it names a real change, and the watcher corrects the picture moments later.
    A read has no such correction, because nothing happened on disk -- and agents
    read ``/etc``, ``~/.claude``, ``node_modules`` and other checkouts all day, so
    the same leniency would hang permanent junk nodes off the top of the tree.

    Hence: a path is accepted only when it lies strictly *under* the root, on a
    path boundary -- comparing the raw prefix would file
    ``/home/x/project-other/a.py`` inside ``/home/x/project``. The root itself is
    refused too: the tree has no node for its own root.

    A prefix test alone is not enough, because ``..`` walks back out through it:
    ``<root>/../other/a.py`` starts with the root and still leaves it, and a
    relative ``../other/a.py`` or ``src/../../other/a.py`` never had a prefix to
    test. So the path is collapsed with :func:`os.path.normpath` FIRST and the
    boundary is checked on the result -- for a relative path that check *is* the
    leading ``..`` the collapse leaves behind. It is purely lexical on purpose:
    this function is pure and hot, and it must not touch the disk. Symlinks therefore still get through; resolving them is
    ``resolve_inside``'s job in the daemon, where a ``stat`` is affordable and
    the path arrives from the network.

    The collapsed form is what gets returned, so ``src/../a.py`` and ``a.py``
    light up ONE node instead of two spellings of the same file. Note ``..`` is
    only an escape as a whole segment: ``..hidden.py`` and ``a..b.py`` are
