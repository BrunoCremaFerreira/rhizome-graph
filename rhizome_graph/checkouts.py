"""Which git checkouts sit *below* a directory -- the downward question.

Every repository question this codebase had walked upward. `repo.find_checkout_root`
climbs from the observed root until it meets a `.git`, and `status.git_status`
gives up -- without forking anything -- the moment that climb comes back empty. So
a workspace root holding five checkouts side by side shows no status panel at
all: not "everything is clean", but silence, which reads exactly like a healthy
repository with nothing pending. The one downward walk that already existed,
`tree.scan_tree`, is the graph's walk and answers the graph's question, so it
steps over a `.git` without ever seeing one.

**Discovery's rule is its own,** `_is_uninteresting`: the structural noise
`tree.is_structural_noise` names, plus *every* dotted directory, permanently.
A working tree is never inside a dotted directory, and this walk runs on every
status round, uncached, on the strength of being 50-100x cheaper than the forks
it decides on (0.2-0.4 ms against ~20 ms). Whatever the graph's walk comes to
hide or show, discovery does not follow it there.

**Why this is its own module.** Not `status.py`: nothing here is about the
porcelain format, and the click router will want the same answer without dragging
the parser in. Not `repo.py`: that module's whole docstring is the upward walk and
its "files, never `subprocess`" doctrine, neither of which says anything about a
walk that goes the other way. This asks one question -- which working trees are
under this path -- and answers it from the filesystem alone.

**This module reaches for `repo` and `tree`, and for nothing else of ours; it
starts no process.** That is a contract, not a preference, and `tests/test_checkouts.py`
asserts it over the parsed source the way the front end asserts "no shiki outside
`highlight.ts`". The status poll calls discovery on every round, uncached, because
it is 50-100x cheaper than the forks it decides on (0.2-0.4 ms against ~20 ms);
route a `git` call through here and that trade quietly inverts, with a caller who
believes the walk is free now paying 5 s timeouts. `gitcmd` stays the one place in
this project where a process is started.

Design notes:
  * **Discovery stops at what it finds.** A root that is itself a checkout answers
    ``[""]`` and looks no further, and a checkout found below the root is not
    descended into. `git status` already reports a nested checkout as a single
    entry, so listing it separately would double-count it and double the forks.
  * **Three budgets, because a walk precedes forks.** What has to be bounded is
    the worst case, not the measured one: a home directory with a network mount
    in it, polled every few seconds.
  * **Never raises.** The caller is a background poll on the daemon's loop. An
    unreadable directory costs results, never an exception.
