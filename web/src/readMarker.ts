/**
 * The ring drawn around a file an agent is READING.
 *
 * A write is a flash that decays; a read is a ring that pulses while it lasts.
 * The two markers are deliberately different shapes as well as different
 * colours: `searchMarker.ts` draws ONE thick ring in cyan around what the user
 * asked for, this one draws TWO thin concentric rings in violet around what an
 * agent is looking at, so the marker still says which is which on a screenshot,
 * on a colour-blind eye, and through the bloom (which washes hue differences
 * out of small bright shapes).
 *
 * Like {@link ./searchMarker} and {@link ./avatar}, the painting is expressed
 * against {@link ReadMarkerContext} -- the slice of `CanvasRenderingContext2D`
 * it actually uses -- so the shape can be exercised without a DOM, a canvas or a
 * GL context. `createReadMarkerCanvas` is the only part that needs a browser.
