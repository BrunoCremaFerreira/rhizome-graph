 *
 * The browser cannot read the disk, so the content is a ROUND TRIP: the click
 * asks the daemon and the answer lands milliseconds later. That makes this a
 * small state machine, and it lives here rather than in the DOM handler for the
 * same reason as {@link ./rootPrompt} and {@link ./search}: `renderer.ts` needs a
 * GL context and cannot be unit-tested, and logic wired straight into a `<div>`
 * is logic no test reaches. Every transition returns a NEW state; nothing is
 * mutated in place.
