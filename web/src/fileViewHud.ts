/**
 * The file viewer: a modal over the graph showing what a file contains.
 *
 * Presentation only — no domain logic. What a click asks for and what a late
 * answer is worth lives in {@link ./fileView}, what Escape means in
 * {@link ./fileViewKeys}, which click dismisses the panel in
 * {@link ./fileViewClicks}, and WHAT to paint — rows, line numbers, gutter
 * width, which lines carry syntax tokens — in {@link ./fileDoc}. This module
 * walks a {@link FileDoc} and builds elements. DOM-bound, so it is not
 * unit-tested: keep it that thin, the way {@link ./searchHud} and
 * {@link ./rootHud} are.
 *
 * Five rules are load-bearing here:
 *
 *  - **`textContent`, never `innerHTML`.** The body is an arbitrary file from
 *    the observed project — a diff of an HTML template, a hex dump, anything.
 *    Assigning it as markup would execute whatever a file happens to contain.
 *    A token's colour goes through the CSSOM (`el.style.color`) for the same
 *    reason, and it survives a future CSP that forbids inline style strings.
 *  - **The scroll position is captured and restored, not merely left alone.**
 *    The syntax tokens land in a second paint, milliseconds after the text; a
 *    `replaceChildren` repositions the scroll on its own while the new children
 *    have no layout yet, so reading a diff would jump to the top the moment it
 *    was coloured.
 *  - **A `null` `rows` is painted as ONE text node**, the fast path the panel
 *    always used: a hex dump, an error, a wait, and any file past the row cap,
 *    where 20 000 elements are the cost being avoided.
 *  - **An empty line keeps its height from CSS (`min-height`), not from a space
 *    smuggled into its text** — that space used to be copied out with the file.
 *  - **One delegated listener on the container,** as in {@link ./statusHud} and
 *    for the same reason: the body is thrown away and rebuilt on every paint, so
 *    a listener bound to anything inside it would have to be re-bound each time.
 *    It resolves the clicked element's id and hands it to
 *    {@link ./fileViewClicks} — whether that click closes anything is not this
 *    module's call.
