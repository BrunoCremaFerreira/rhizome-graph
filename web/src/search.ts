/**
 * Finding a node by name: what a typed query matches, and what the search box
 * is doing.
 *
 * A seeded project opens with its whole tree on screen, and past
 * FILE_LABEL_ZOOM_THRESHOLD none of it is named -- so locating one known file
 * means dragging the camera around reading labels until it turns up. This module
 * answers "where is renderer.ts?".
 *
 * Pure data and pure transforms, free of three.js and of the DOM, for the same
 * reason as {@link ./view} and {@link ./labels}: the renderer needs a GL context
 * and cannot be unit-tested, and a keyboard handler wired straight into the DOM
 * would bury this logic where no test can reach it. Every transition returns a
 * NEW state, like `ViewState`; nothing here is mutated in place.
 *
 * Two matching rules carry the weight:
 *
 *  - a query with no `/` matches only the LAST SEGMENT, so typing `src` while
 *    hunting for a file does not drag in everything under `web/src`;
 *  - a query containing `/` matches the whole relative path, which is the only
 *    way to ask for a subtree.
 *
 * And the result list is ordered BY PATH, never by arrival: F3 walks it frame
 * after frame while the force layout keeps moving the nodes, so an order that
 * depended on anything but the paths themselves would make "next match" jump at
 * random.

 *  - when the active path is gone the index falls back to a real match (clamped
 *    at `matches.length - 1`), since the camera is sent to `matches[activeIndex]`
 *    every frame;
 *  - `frame` survives, so an approach stays an approach;
 *  - an empty query does NOT close the box, unlike `setQuery`, where emptiness
 *    means the user deleted the text.
