/**
 * Contract tests (RED) for graph search: matching paths and the search box's
 * state machine.
 *
 * The defect is navigational. The seed walk publishes the whole observed
 * project, so the graph opens with hundreds of nodes; past
 * FILE_LABEL_ZOOM_THRESHOLD nothing is named at all, and finding one known file
 * means dragging the camera around reading labels until it turns up. There is no
 * way to ask "where is renderer.ts?".
 *
 * Everything the feature decides -- which nodes a typed query means, which one
 * F3 lands on next, and when the box closes -- is pure data. It lives here for
 * the same reason as {@link ../src/view} and {@link ../src/labels}: renderer.ts
 * needs a GL context and cannot be unit-tested, and a keyboard handler wired
 * straight into the DOM would put this logic somewhere no test can reach.
 *
 * Two matching rules carry the weight. A query with no `/` matches only the LAST
 * SEGMENT, because typing `src` while looking for a file should not drag in
 * every file under `web/src`; a query containing `/` matches the whole relative
 * path, because that is the only way to ask for a subtree. And the result list
 * is ORDERED BY PATH, not by arrival: F3 walks that list frame after frame while
 * the force layout keeps moving the nodes, so an order that depends on anything
 * but the paths themselves would make "next match" jump at random.
 *
 * Expected to FAIL until src/search.ts exists.
 *
 * A second defect motivates `refreshMatches`. This graph is LIVE: nodes appear
 * and disappear on every WebSocket event, so a result list computed when the
 * query was typed goes stale within seconds -- a file created after the search
 * opened is never found, and one deleted stays highlighted at a position the
 * camera can still be sent to. The only recomputation available today is
 * `setQuery`, which by contract restarts the walk at index 0 and returns to
 * `frame: "all"`; driving it from the event stream would yank anyone stepping
 * through matches with F3 back to the overview a second later. Recomputing is
 * not typing, so it preserves the walk -- the ACTIVE PATH, not the active index,
 * because a new match sorting before it shifts every index -- and it does not
 * close the box on an empty query.
 *
 * A third defect motivates `focusedFilePath`. The walk puts the camera on a file
 * and stops there: seeing what is INSIDE the file just found means leaving the
 * keyboard and clicking a dot in a force layout that never stops moving. Enter
 * should open it, which requires one pure answer -- WHICH path Enter would open,
 * or null. It is null far more often than not, and every one of those cases is a
 * real state of this box: a query typed but never walked (`frame: "all"` focuses
 * nothing, because the camera is framing them all), a closed box, a query that
 * matched nothing, a walk resting on a DIRECTORY (the click path only ever opens
 * files and the viewer has nothing to show for a directory), and -- the live
 * graph again -- an active path that has left the tree between the walk and the
 * keystroke, which `refreshMatches` is allowed to leave pointing at nothing.
