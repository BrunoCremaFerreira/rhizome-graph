/**
 * Contract tests (RED) for the HUD's recent-activity list.
 *
 * Three defects motivate this module, all of which make the list useless as a
 * read of "what just happened":
 *
 *  1. On connect the daemon replays the ENTIRE project tree as `origin: "seed"`
 *     `A` events -- tens to thousands of them. A list that accepts those opens
 *     already full of backdrop, and the first real edit scrolls off the top
 *     before anyone reads it. Seed is dropped here, and only seed: a `watch`
 *     event with `agent: ""` is a real change nobody could be credited for and
 *     must still be listed.
 *  2. A single save fires the hook AND the watcher, and agents re-edit the same
 *     file repeatedly; without collapsing, one file's name fills the panel.
 *     Collapsing must apply ONLY against the entry currently on top -- folding a
 *     new occurrence into an older entry further down would silently reorder the
 *     list under the reader's eye.
 *  3. A long session cannot grow an unbounded array behind the HUD.
 *
 * `splitPath` lives here rather than in the DOM/HUD element because deciding
 * where a path breaks into directory and file name is arithmetic on a string,
 * and the test environment is `node` with no DOM.
 *
 * Expected to FAIL until src/eventLog.ts exists. One failure reason per test.

/**
 * The fourth operation (`R`, an agent reading a file) must stay out of this

 * The panel is titled by what it is: recent CHANGES. An agent reads roughly ten
 * times more often than it writes -- it greps, it opens the file it is about to
 * edit, it reads back what it wrote -- so admitting reads would push every real
 * edit off the top within seconds, and the one question the list answers ("what
 * just changed?") would no longer be answerable from it. The graph shows reads;
 * this list does not.
 *
 * Folding is the subtler half. Repeats collapse against the TOP entry, so a
 * read of the file just modified would otherwise either fold into the write's
 * line (inflating its count with work that changed nothing) or, if the type
 * differs, open a line of its own. Neither is acceptable: the read must leave
 * the list byte for byte as it found it.
