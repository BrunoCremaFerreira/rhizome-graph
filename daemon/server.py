"""Aggregator daemon: fan-in from hooks, fan-out to browsers.

Two servers share one event loop:

  * **Ingest** -- a Unix domain socket (``RHIZOME_SOCKET``, default
    ``/tmp/rhizome-graph.sock``) that receives newline-delimited JSON hook
    payloads from :mod:`hooks.emit_event`. Each line is normalized here, which
    is also where the "already seen paths" set lives (single source of truth for
    add-vs-modify), so the hook stays a dumb, dependency-free forwarder.
  * **Broadcast** -- a WebSocket at ``/ws`` relaying every normalized event to
    all connected browsers as JSON. A new client first receives a short replay
    of the most recent events so the graph never starts empty.

The WebSocket is no longer output-only. The observed root used to be frozen at
boot by ``RHIZOME_PROJECT_ROOT``, so watching a second project meant killing
the daemon; the page can now retype it, which means frames also travel *inbound*:
``{"kind":"complete"}`` (answer a ``Tab``, because only the daemon can read the
daemon's disk), ``{"kind":"setRoot"}`` (observe another project) and
``{"kind":"file"}`` (what is *inside* the node that was clicked: its diff, its
text, or a hex dump). All are answered to that client alone -- one viewer
pressing ``Tab`` or opening a panel must not repaint the screen of everybody else
watching the same daemon.

Inbound commands are **loopback-only by default** (:func:`control_allowed`):
``setRoot`` makes the daemon walk an arbitrary directory and re-seed from it, and
``file`` hands over file *contents*, so exempting the latter because "it only
reads" would turn an open port into a file server for the whole project. An
SSH tunnel and VS Code port forwarding both arrive as loopback, so the ordinary
remote setup keeps working untouched; ``RHIZOME_ALLOW_REMOTE_CONTROL=1``
deliberately opens it to the rest of the network.

Both the WebSocket and the built frontend in ``web/dist`` are served from a
*single* port (``RHIZOME_HTTP_PORT``, default 8080): a request arrives as a
WebSocket upgrade or as a plain GET, and one listener answers both. That means a
remote viewer (SSH or VS Code port forwarding) needs exactly one forwarded port,
and the page derives its socket URL from the origin it was loaded from -- a
separate WS port would resolve to the *viewer's* machine and never connect.
When ``web/dist`` is absent the Vite dev server hosts the front and proxies
``/ws`` here.

Unlike the hook, the daemon may use third-party dependencies (``websockets``).
Robustness rule: one misbehaving or disconnecting client must never take down
the server.

    """One frame off the network as a command, or ``None``.

    This is data typed by a human into a field and shipped over a socket, so it
    must **never raise**: an exception here kills the task serving that browser.
    Every unrecognized shape -- malformed JSON, a bare array, a missing
    required field -- collapses to ``None``.

    **Which field is required depends on the kind.** ``complete``, ``setRoot``
    and ``file`` each name a ``path`` and are refused without a string one;
    ``search`` names a ``query`` instead and is refused without a string one; and
    ``sizes`` names **nothing at all** -- "how big is everything you are
    drawing?" has no argument, so there is no field it can be refused for.
    Reusing ``path`` for the query would be a lie: both gates below echo
    ``command["path"]`` back in their refusal, so a query smuggled through it
    would be quoted at the user as the path that was refused. A ``search`` and a
    ``sizes`` therefore parse with ``path: ""`` -- the echo field is still there,
    holding the only path either of them has. That makes ``sizes`` the one
    command in this protocol that turns no string from the network into
    anything, which is the whole of its security story: there is no containment
    check to add because there is nothing to contain, and a field it would never
    use is ignored rather than fatal.

    The parsed mapping always carries ``kind``, ``path`` and ``token``; a fourth
    key appears **only** when the frame carried it in a form this daemon
    understands for that kind, so ``query`` is present for a ``search`` and
    absent everywhere else, and ``prefer`` is present for a ``file`` **only**
    when the frame said exactly ``"text"`` -- absent, ``"diff"``, ``"TEXT"`` or a
    number all parse without it and so reach today's diff-first chain. That
    reading is the fail-safe one: the worst case of dropping the key is a diff
    where text was wanted, while the worst case of guessing at it is a read
    route reached by accident. That is the rule the conditional ``repo`` key
    follows on the status side, and here it is what keeps the shape of the three
    older commands byte-identical: an unconditional ``query`` would widen every
    one of them for no behavioural reason.

    The path -- and the query -- are handed on exactly as typed: trimming and
    ``~`` expansion belong to :mod:`rhizome_graph.paths`, the ASCII fold belongs
    to :mod:`rhizome_graph.content_search`, and the answer echoes this text back
    so the page can tell whether it still matches what the viewer has in the
    field.

    Every command carries a ``token``, always the key and never its absence: a

    a string -- ``null``, a number, an object -- collapses to the same empty
    string. That keeps a hostile value away from ``hmac.compare_digest``, which

    make: the empty token, which
    :func:`rhizome_graph.token.token_matches` always refuses, against one that
