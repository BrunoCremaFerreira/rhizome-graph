"""The project speaks English, everywhere a human reads it.

Motivation: the HUD once counted uncommitted changes in Portuguese under an
English keys legend, and `start.sh` explained itself in Portuguese to whoever
ran it. Mixed languages are worse than either one alone -- a reader has to
switch mid-sentence, and a grep for a message they saw on screen finds nothing.

What this guards is the *authored* surface: identifiers, comments, docstrings,
and every string a user can end up reading (HUD text, shell log lines, help
output). It scans production sources, shell scripts and the agent definitions.

Two deliberate exclusions:

  * **`tests/` and `web/tests/`.** Encoding behaviour has to be specified with
    real non-ASCII bytes -- a `looks_binary` fixture, a `git status` path that
    forces `core.quotePath` -- so accented fixtures there are the point, not a
    slip. Test *prose* is still English by rule; it is just not machine-checked.
  * **Generated and vendored trees** (`web/dist`, `node_modules`, lockfiles).

The check is two-pronged: an accented Latin letter (which no English word in
this codebase uses), and a small list of unambiguous Portuguese words that
carry no accent. Neither is a language detector; both are enough to catch the
way this actually goes wrong, which is a whole comment or message written in
the other language. A corollary for the files it scans, `CLAUDE.md` included:
describe the forbidden text, never quote it, or the document fails its own rule.
