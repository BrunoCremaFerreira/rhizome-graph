"""Contract tests (RED) for rhizome_graph.cli: argv + environ + cwd -> Settings.

Motivation: `daemon/server.py` has no value anywhere that describes "how this
instance is configured". `main()` reads four variables out of `os.environ` and
hands three scalars to `run()`, and four more environment reads happen *inside*
the machinery instead of at the entry: `_status_poll_interval()`,
`_allow_remote_control()`, `Session.__init__`'s token, and the obsolete
`RHIZOME_WS_PORT` warning. `run()` then decides two more things on its own -- the
static root and `host=""`.

That works because there is exactly one caller shape: a shell script that
exports variables and execs a module. An installed `rhi` is a *second* front
door with different inputs -- a positional directory, a port that may have to
move, a window to open -- and building it by having `rhi` set `os.environ` and
call `main()` would make the environment an internal protocol between two parts
of one program: unreadable in a stack trace, untestable without a subprocess,
and impossible to run twice in one process.

So the configuration becomes a value, in the shape the rest of this codebase
already uses for decisions (`paths.py`, `status.py`, `pick.ts`): a frozen
`Settings`, and a pure `settings_from(args, environ, cwd)` that is total, does
no I/O and never calls `sys.exit`. `cwd` is a parameter for exactly the reason
`home` is one in `paths.py` -- a function that reads the process's own working
directory cannot be tested from another one.

Two properties carry the whole module and are pinned as tables rather than as
examples:

  * **Precedence: flag > environment > default, for every field.** One example
    proves one field; the table proves the rule, and the rule is what the second
    front door depends on.
  * **`~` and relative paths mean here exactly what they mean in the `ctrl+L`
    bar.** The bar resolves through `rhizome_graph.paths.resolve_root`, so this
    must agree with it -- a second rule for `~` in the CLI is a bug waiting for
    the first user who types one and gets a different directory in each place.

`settings_from` cannot simply *call* `resolve_root`, and that is not an
oversight: `resolve_root` asks the disk whether the path is a directory and
resolves relative paths against the process's cwd. Purity here means the
agreement is asserted over real directories instead (see part 3), while a path
that does not exist still yields a `Settings` rather than `None` -- refusing an
unwritten project directory is a decision for the caller that can print, not for
a pure function.

Style: Arrange-Act-Assert, one property per test.
