"""Contract tests (RED) for the multi-repository branch of rhizome_graph.status.

Motivation, and it is a silence rather than a wrong answer: `git_status` asks one
question and gets one answer. `find_checkout_root(root)` walks *upward*, so a
workspace root of the `~/projects/{a,b,c}` shape -- no `.git` at or above it, five
of them directly below -- returns `None` before forking anything, and the panel
that exists to say "there is uncommitted work here" is not on screen at all. That
reads exactly like a clean tree, which is the one thing it must never be confused
with. Everything after the early return -- the fork, the parse, the relativize --
is reachable only in the single-repo case.

This file is R2 of `docs/features/done/2026-08-17-16-21-multi-repo-git-status.md`. It is a **new
file, deliberately**: `tests/test_status.py`'s 62 assertions stay byte-identical,
so a reviewer can see that nothing about today's single-repo behaviour moved.

Five properties are what these tests are really about, because they are the ones
a later change is most likely to break:

  * **Upward wins, structurally.** If the root is a checkout, or sits inside one,
    the downward walk does not happen at all -- not "happens and is discarded".
    That is what makes backwards compatibility a shape rather than a list of
    regression tests, and it is pinned with a spy that must record *zero* calls.
  * **A map, not a filter.** `relativize` strips a prefix and drops what falls
    outside; the multi-repo case is the inverse and prepends. They are two moods
    of one idea and are deliberately two functions, because one function with two
    moods is a function whose tests you have to re-read to know which mood each
    one pins.
  * **Fairness is the whole point of the interleave.** `status_frame` cuts the
    head at 200. Over a list ordered repo-by-repo, one repository with 300
    untracked files fills the entire cut and hides every other repository --
    which is this feature's own failure mode, moved one level up. Round-robin
    makes the *existing* cut fair with no new constant and no signature change.
  * **The walk precedes forks, so it is bounded and it is off the loop.** Four
    concurrent `git status` calls at a 5 s timeout each is the ceiling on a poll
    round; and discovery itself is filesystem work, which on the loop's own
    thread would freeze every connected browser for as long as a network mount
    feels like taking.
  * **The per-repository cap must not silence `truncated`.** It is a memory
    bound and nothing else, so it is set one entry *above* what a frame can
    show. Cut to exactly `DEFAULT_MAX_ENTRIES`, a lone sub-repository of 300
    pending changes would make `status_frame`'s `len(entries) > len(shown)`
    answer `False` and the panel would call a cut list complete -- while the
    same repository observed directly reports it cut. The frame must make one
    claim about completeness, not two decided by where the root is pointed.
  * **The semaphore is created inside the call.** A module-level
    `asyncio.Semaphore` binds to the first loop that blocks on it and raises on
    every loop after that. It passes every single-loop functional test and fails
    the second time a daemon's loop is created, so there is a test here whose only
    job is to run the same call under two successive loops.

Real repositories under `tmp_path` wherever the behaviour is "what `git` says",
following `tests/test_status.py`'s own `_repo` idiom. Where the behaviour under
test is orchestration -- concurrency, budgets, ordering -- `run_git` is stubbed
instead, because a fork tells you nothing about how many forks were in flight.

Style: Arrange-Act-Assert, one property per test.

# N and that nobody can choose.

# is derived in `status_frame` as `len(entries) > len(shown)`, so a lone
# sub-repository with 300 pending changes, cut to exactly 200 on the way in,
# produces `200 > 200` -- `False`. The panel would state the list is complete
# over a list that was cut. The same repository observed directly, with no cap
# in front of it, reports `truncated: True`: same repository, same 300 changes,
# two different claims about whether the viewer is seeing everything, decided by
# nothing but whether the observed root happens to sit one directory higher.
# `truncated` exists because "a silently cut list reads as the whole truth", in
