"""Contract tests (RED) for run() being configured by a Settings, not by the air.

Motivation: `run()` today is configured by three scalars plus four ambient
reads it performs itself or delegates -- `_status_poll_interval()`,
`_allow_remote_control()`, `Session.__init__`'s token,
`default_web_dist(os.environ)` -- and two decisions it makes alone: the static
root and `host=""`. Nothing describes the resulting instance, so nothing can
start a second one differently in the same process, and every test of a
configured behaviour has to reach for `monkeypatch.setenv`.

The load-bearing test in this file is the first one, and what makes it load
bearing is what is *missing* from it: **`os.environ` is stripped of every
`RHIZOME_*` variable before `run()` is called, and the `Settings` is built from
an empty environ mapping.** If the daemon still serves the right page, on the
right port, from the right directory, then the ambient read is genuinely gone --
not merely shadowed by a value that happens to agree with it. An empty
environment IS the assertion.

The composition test in part 2 reads the opposite way on purpose, and the pair
is not a contradiction: `RHIZOME_WEB_DIST` remains a perfectly legitimate
*source* for that setting -- it simply has to travel through `settings_from` into
a `Settings` field, instead of being read from the air at the moment the
listener is built. Part 1 says the air is not consulted; part 2 says the
variable still arrives. Both have to hold, and only together do they describe
the seam.

`Settings` values are built with `dataclasses.replace` over a `settings_from`
answer rather than by calling the constructor with every field: these tests care
about four fields, and a fifth added later must not have to be spelled here.

Style: Arrange-Act-Assert, one property per test.
