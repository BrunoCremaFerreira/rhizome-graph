"""Contract tests (RED) for rhizome_graph.checkouts -- the downward question.

Motivation: every repository question in this codebase walks *upward*.
`repo.find_checkout_root` climbs from the observed root until it meets a `.git`,
and `status.git_status` returns `None` -- without forking anything -- the moment
that climb comes back empty. So a workspace root like `~/projects`, holding five
checkouts side by side, shows no status panel at all: not "everything is clean",
but silence, which reads exactly like a healthy repository with nothing to
report. The one downward walk that does exist, `tree.scan_tree`, prunes every
dotted directory in place, so it can never *see* a `.git` even when it steps
right over one.

This module is that missing question: "which checkouts sit below this
directory". It is filesystem-reading and pure of policy -- no `git`, no network,
no state -- which is what lets the status poll call it on every round without a
cache (measured at 0.2-0.4 ms against ~20 ms of forks it precedes).

Three properties are worth naming up front, because they are the ones a later
change is most likely to break:

  * **Upward wins, and discovery stops at what it finds.** A root that is itself
    a checkout answers `[""]` and does not go looking for more; a checkout found
    below the root is not descended into either. Otherwise a repository with a
    vendored checkout inside it would be counted twice and forked twice, and
    `git status` already reports the nested one as a single entry.
  * **Three budgets, because the walk precedes forks.** A fork is ~4 ms warm and
    its timeout is 5 s, so what has to be bounded is the worst case and not the
    measured one. `MAX_DEPTH`, `MAX_CHECKOUTS` and `MAX_SCANNED_DIRS` are pinned
    here by name and by value: they are the only thing standing between a poll
    every 3 s and a home directory with a network mount in it.
  * **Never raises, ever.** The caller is a background poll on the daemon's
    loop. An unreadable directory must cost results, never an exception.

On what "depth" counts. The table in `docs/features/done/2026-08-17-16-21-multi-repo-git-status.md`
justifies `MAX_DEPTH = 3` as "covers `~/projects/a` and `~/src/github.com/org/repo`",
so depth is counted here in **segments of the returned prefix**: `github.com/org/repo`
is three and must be found, `a/b/c/d` is four and must not. That reading is the
one the constant's stated purpose requires; the table's shorthand "`org/repo/.git`"
is satisfied by it too.

The module boundary is asserted structurally at the end of this file, in the same
spirit as `tests/test_daemon_environment_boundary.py` and the "no shiki outside
`highlight.ts`" rule on the front end: `checkouts.py` may reach for `repo` and
`tree` and nothing else of ours, and it forks nothing. A source-level assertion
is what stops the next change routing a `git` call through here, where a caller
that believes discovery is cheap would be paying 5 s timeouts without knowing it.

Style: Arrange-Act-Assert, one property per test.
