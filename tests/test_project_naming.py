"""The project is called rhizome-graph, everywhere the name is load-bearing.

Motivation: a rename that stops halfway is worse than no rename. The name is
not decoration here -- it is the ingest socket path that the hook and the daemon
have to agree on independently (two files, two literals, no shared constant), it
is the distribution/import package every test and the daemon itself import by
name, and it is what the page calls itself in the one place a user reads it.

Each of those can be renamed alone and leave the tree running until the exact
moment it does not: a hook writing to `/tmp/<old>.sock` while the daemon listens
on `/tmp/<new>.sock` loses every attributed event and produces the *specific*
failure this project has already paid for once -- a graph that updates with
nobody on camera, indistinguishable from "no agent is working right now".

The socket assertions are deliberately literal. Comparing the hook's constant to
the daemon's would pass while both were wrong; each is pinned to the string, and
then to each other.
