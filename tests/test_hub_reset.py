"""Contract tests (RED) for EventHub.reset: switching the observed project.

Motivation: the root is fixed at boot (``RHIZOME_PROJECT_ROOT`` reaches the
hub, the watcher, the tree scan and the branch poll), so looking at a second
project means restarting the daemon. The new feature repoints it at runtime, and
`reset` is the moment of the switch on the server side.

It cannot be a matter of assigning a new string. Every piece of state the hub
keeps belongs to the *old* project and is actively wrong for the new one:

  * ``_known_paths`` decides add-vs-modify. Left behind, the first Write to
    ``src/app.py`` in the new project is drawn as a modification of a node the
    page has never seen -- this is the concrete defect that makes the reset
    necessary at all, not an aesthetic cleanup.
  * ``_seed`` / ``_recent`` are the replay. Left behind, a browser connecting a
    second later is handed the previous project's tree and its recent activity.
  * ``_last_hook`` owns whatever the watcher reports next. Left behind, the first
    change in the new project is credited to an agent that was working somewhere
    else.
  * ``_hook_paths`` / ``_fs_paths`` suppress echoes of changes that happened
    before the switch, so the first real event in the new project can be silently
    swallowed as a duplicate.
  * ``_pending`` holds the changes the watcher has seen and the hub has not
    published yet -- deferred for ``FS_SETTLE_SECONDS`` so a hook can supersede
    them. Left behind, a callback fires a quarter of a second after the switch
    and publishes a path of the *abandoned* project into a hub whose
    ``_known_paths`` has just been emptied, so it is drawn as an **add**, in a
    project where it does not exist, and it is clickable -- a click
    `resolve_inside` then refuses. Every handle has to be cancelled, not merely
    forgotten: a forgotten handle still fires.

The clients already on screen must be told: `reset` broadcasts
``{"kind": "reset", "root": ...}`` and keeps it in a slot of its own -- exactly
like ``_meta`` -- so a client connecting *after* the switch gets the same
instruction to clear its canvas, before the new tree arrives.

Unlike ``set_meta``, resetting to the same root is not a no-op: the caller is
asking for a clean slate, not announcing a difference.

Style: Arrange-Act-Assert, one failure reason per test.
