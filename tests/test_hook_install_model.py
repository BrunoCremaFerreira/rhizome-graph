"""Contract tests (RED) for the pure model behind hook installation and doctoring.

Motivation: the whole point of this project is **attribution** -- the graph shows
*which agent* did what -- and attribution exists only if the `hooks` block from
`config/settings.json` is inside the OBSERVED project's `.claude/settings.json`.
Today that is a manual copy-paste, and CLAUDE.md records what its absence looks
like: the tree updates while nobody is on camera, which is indistinguishable from
"no agent is working right now". That ambiguity cost real hours.

**`rhi` diagnoses always, offers explicitly, and never writes silently.** Three
reasons, and they are why this is a diagnosis module rather than a "fix it for
me" one:

  * `.claude/settings.json` is a **committed file in many repositories** -- it is
    committed in this one. A tool that edits it as a side effect of "show me a
    graph" writes into the user's git working tree unasked, and the user finds
    out from `git status` afterwards.
  * **A merge can clobber.** The observed project may already hold `PostToolUse`
    hooks with a different matcher -- a formatter, a linter, somebody's audit
    log. Merging JSON hook arrays silently is how one of those is lost.
  * **The real failure mode is rot, not absence.** Live evidence, from this very
    session: all three settings files in this repository named a hook under a
    directory that stopped existing when the project was renamed, and *every
    tool call* came back with a blocking hook error. CLAUDE.md documents a
    missing hook as producing **silence**; a stale absolute path fails
    differently and worse -- loud, attached to every call, degrading the agent
    session rather than the graph. Writing a file is a one-time act; checking
    that what is written still resolves has ongoing value, which is why
    `diagnose` is the centre of this module and the merge is the sideshow.

That last point is what `stale` is for, and the input it is specified with below
is the exact broken command that was in this repository.

**Five states, not four.** `absent`, `stale`, `foreign`, `installed` -- and
`malformed`, for a `.claude/settings.json` that is not JSON at all. It earns its
place because the remedy differs: absent is written into, malformed must never
be, and a reader told only "no hook found" would reach for `--install-hooks` and
have their unparseable-but-precious file replaced. The line between `absent` and
`foreign` is drawn at **contest, not content**: absent means nothing claims
`PostToolUse` at all, so a merge has nothing to lose; foreign means somebody
else's hooks are already there, so a person should be told before we touch it.
Neither is a refusal -- `merge_hook_block` keeps the stranger's entry intact --
they are different things to say.

**One file at a time, and one verdict over several.** `diagnose` answers about a
single `settings.json`, because that is what a state means; Claude Code merges
hooks from the user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` and the project's own, so
`rhi --doctor` reads both and combines the two answers through `overall_state`.
That combination is pure logic over five constants and belongs beside them,
where it can be specified without a subprocess -- see section 7b for the
precedence and the reason behind each step of it.

**Pure, and pinned as pure.** No filesystem, no environment, no daemon imports.
`command_exists` is injected for exactly that reason: `stale` is the state that
matters most and it is a question about the disk, so the disk is a parameter and
the tests need none. The caller owns `$PATH`, `shlex` and `os.path`; this module
owns the JSON shape.

**What is NOT specified here:** where the hook command actually is on this
machine (`rhizome_graph.assets`, specified in `tests/test_hook_dependencies.py`),
and what `rhi` does with any of it (`tests/test_hook_doctor.py`,
`tests/test_hook_install_command.py`). One cross-module round trip lives at the
bottom, because "the command we write is a command we then recognise" is a
property neither module can state alone.

The module under specification is imported per test rather than at file level:
while it does not exist, a top-level import fails at *collection* and takes the
whole file's report with it.

Style: Arrange-Act-Assert, one property per test.
