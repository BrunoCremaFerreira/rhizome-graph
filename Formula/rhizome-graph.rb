# The Homebrew formula, at the path that makes this repository a tap:
#   brew tap BrunoCremaFerreira/rhizome-graph https://github.com/BrunoCremaFerreira/rhizome-graph
#   brew install BrunoCremaFerreira/rhizome-graph/rhizome-graph
#
# Two decisions here are not style, and both come from the same fact: the built
# front end is gitignored.
#
#   1. `url` fetches a RELEASE ASSET, never a tag archive. The line every
#      formula starts with -- ".../archive/refs/tags/v1.0.tar.gz" -- is
#      generated from the git tree, so it carries no web/dist at all. It
#      downloads, builds and installs perfectly and serves a blank page,
#      because the daemon treats a missing front end as "serve the WebSocket
#      alone" rather than as an error. The asset named below is what
#      `python -m build` produces, and it carries the page inside the import
#      package at rhizome_graph/web/ -- the one place
#      rhizome_graph/assets.py looks on an installed system.
#   2. Nothing here builds the front end. No Node, no bundler, no registry: it
#      would put a JavaScript toolchain on every user's machine to reproduce an
#      artifact the release already contains, take minutes, fail on a network
#      that cannot reach the registry, and serve a bundle nobody tested.
#
# Unverified, and it has to be said rather than implied: no `brew` and no ruby
# exist on the machine this was written on, so `brew audit --strict --online`,
# `brew install --build-from-source` and `brew test` have never been run against
# it. tests/test_homebrew_formula.py reads it as text and says so at length.

  # The tag carries the release number as CLAUDE.md spells it; the ASSET

      Attribution is opt-in. Copy the PostToolUse block into the .claude/settings.json
      of the project you want to watch, naming this command:

        #{opt_bin}/rhi-hook

      Without it every event arrives with no author, no figure appears, and the
      graph looks alive and unattended -- which is indistinguishable from nobody
      working right now.

      git is used for the diff view and the uncommitted-changes panel only; the
      graph does not need it.
